							<u><strong><a href="https://www.love-smiles.org/">Love Smiles</a></strong></u> is an Illinois-based non-profit focusing on pediatric cancer awareness and support. This design started as a three month graduate school project aimed towards assisting local organizations with their design related needs.
							The founder came to us asking for a landing page for the existing Love Smiles mobile app, however our team deemed the existing app inadequate and decided to build out a full website instead. 
							<br>
							<br>
							After the initial project was completed I was contacted by the founder to continue working with them on the website. Since then I have reworked certain sections of the website to better promote publisher and author partners. Additionally, I implemented
							the Love Smiles online store which features a program that has helped send over 150 gifts to children battling cancer in the time it's been running.

										<i><h3> "I wanted to give other parents the peaceful moments I had found." - Jenna Brown, Love Smiles Founder </h3></i>		
										<br>
										<span class="palt">
											Love Smiles is an Illinois-based 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to bringing awareness to pediatric cancer that works with childrenâ€™s 
											authors to provide special moments for children and their families fighting pediatric cancer.
											The founder hoped to provide stories to children and parents to hopefully give them peaceful, normal moments amidst the endless appointments and procedures that she and her daughter had also gone through. 
											<br>
											<br>
											Love Smiles can to use with a request for a landing page to bring people to their mobile app. Despite the limited time-frame we had to work with, our team decided to expand the scope of the project to include a full website after 
											initial reviews of the mobile app which raised worries over it's usability and user experience.
										</span>
										<div class="ParagraghIndent" >
											<h4>The Challenge</h4>
											<span class="palt">
												With a limited amount of time, which was originally meant to be used solely for a landing page, we were up against the clock. <br>
												Additionally, even before initially scoping out the size of the project, we knew we were going to have to meet the needs <br>
												of multiple different groups with this design while leaving room for future growth.

										<i><h3> <u>Our main goal at this point was to create the main portal for Love Smiles </u></h3></i>	
										<br>
										<span class="palt ">
											We knew after an initial review that we needed to provide Love Smiles more than just a landing page. Their existing mobile application was mess, it would not have held up to the ambitious goals and content the founder had set her eyes on.
											Additionally, Love Smiles at this point was extremely limited in their online presence, 
											operating mainly through a Facebook page, the organization's information was essentially being gatekept by either a Facebook account or a mobile app download, which resulted in users in the past asking for a more straightforward
											website instead.  
											<br>
											<br>
											Our goal with the website was to provide solutions for these problems while also providing a platform that potential business partners would be more likely to work with. We wanted the new Love Smiles website
											to be where users are sent to first, where the main content was housed, and most importantly completely replace the existing app with a functional mobile version as well.

														collected during our discovery phase through interviewing the founder and compartmented them into easy to digest points and ideas that we could reference going forward. This project brief was also used as a presentation piece to show the 
														Love Smiles board that we understood their current issues and needs and give them confidence in our ability to produce exactly what they needed.

													<br>Apart from the information we gathered from the founder herself, our team wanted to see what other similar organization were doing and providing with their websites. We took a look at dozens of examples, and ultimately narrowed down our
													focus to four organizations who we thought were the most similar to Love Smiles. We used these websites, alongside the information we gathered from the founder, to assist us in creative a rough list of features that we felt were requried for such a website and color coded
													them so that we could focus on those which felt were more important.

																<br>
																<span class="palt">
																	From our initial conversation with Jenna, the founder of Love Smiles, we had a good idea of who our users were going to be as she had gone through a similar journey with her own daughter and thus understood the different
																	types of people at every step of the recovery process. Using that information we created the following personas/profiles to allow us to get a better understanding of each different type of potential user and their specific needs.
																	For example, the needs of a publisher or author will not directly overlap with the needs of a caregiver or child, and yet we have to include both of their needs into the website in a coherent way.

													<span class="palt">
														We had one main goal with our first round of user research at this point in time: <strong><i>Information Architecture & Clear Terminology</i></strong>. 
														<br>
														<br>
														Because we had a large amount of potential content we had to take into account when creating the website we knew that the most important thing to keep in mind was making sure content was where it was expected to be and that getting there felt natural.
														Thus we started by recruiting <strong>26 participants </strong> for a tree test aimed to iron out any issues we potentially had with the structure of the website, the terminology we were using, and make sure users understood where various content was housed.

																	For our second round of user testing we recruited we recruited families of pediatric cancer patients,

																	opinions on the website's visuals as well as a task analysis involving <strong>8 tasks</strong> which asked users to navigate to different sections of the website so that we could get a grasp on the revised information architecture and terminology.
																	Collection of this data was followed by an affinity diagram to better understand the themes of issues that had arisen throughout the testing. While some of the issues we had previously had seemingly been resolved through the work we did previously, a couple new issued arised, as seen below, which we had to take care of going forward.

													can be refined, and as our time was running low we chose which issues to prioritize more heavily from the data we collected during our research. 
													<br>
													<br>
													First, we created the following finalized style guide to make sure anyone working on the website in the future could keep the same visual style easily.

														research and aimed to make section of the website easier to find and interact with.

														<i><h3> Example of Issue 1 solution</h3></i>		
														<br>
														<span class="palt">
															Below is an image of the finalized Love Smiles Homepage. During our second round of testing, participants were observed to be attempting to click on the yellow banners, which were purely decorative
															at the time and did not have accompanying buttons linking them to their respective sections. Participants were having trouble finding these sections as we initially intended so a simple solution was,

													<i><h3> Setting Them Up For Success</h3></i>		
													<br>
													<span class="palt">
														After successfully launching the website, which the founder and her board members loved, we decided to finish the project by giving them a <strong><i>list of future recommendations</i></strong> that aligned not only with
														their own aspirations of growth, but also provided a direction for anyone they employed to work on the website in the future. 
														<br>
														<br>
														<ul>
															<li>Provide a way to opt-into notifications when a new major feature or page is added to the website</li>
															<li>Keep the purpose of the website in mind as the organization grows</li>
															<li>Test with users periodically as the content is finalized and links are updated or changed</li>
															<li> Experiment with different logo designs to integrate the logo with the overall website typeface.</li>
														  </ul>
														
														
														The first recommendation from the list specifically resulted
														from the research we did that pointed towards users <i>wanting</i> to be informed about new content or events. We thus came to the conclusion that for users not following the Love Smiles social media platforms, 
														these notifications would be the  "reminders" to keep users steadily returning and hopefully taking part in Love Smiles' events. The caveat being that because the website was new and quickly growing, giving users the ability to set the frequency of these notifications
														would be helpful as to not inundate them with every single update.

															<i><h3> Continued Partnership</h3></i>		
															<br>
															<span class="palt">
																I was contacted by the founder of Love Smiles around a month after our initial project to come back and continue working with them and the website. I agreed to return and work on whatever they need, which first meant cleaning up
																some minor issues that resulted from our original limited time-frame such as some SEO problems, dead links, and organization of downloadable partner materials. However, the major work I've done for them has been a <strong>redesign of the authors page </strong> which
																resulted in many more profiles being able to included on a single page in an organized manner as well as the <strong>creation and implementation of an online store for Love Smiles </strong>to sell merchandise and gift packages that can be 
															 	donated to children in hospitals. Examples of both pages can be seen below.
																<br>
																<br>
																Currently we are working on expanding the partners page, which involves communicating with both the Love Smiles board members as well as publisher partners, such as Penguin Random House, 
																so that we can provide partners with effective promotion and visibility on the website while not intruding on the overall user experience.
