						The initial idea for this project came after noticing a clear lack of the classic zoo management style of games often seen on computers. In fact, there is a distinct lack of
						management style games in general on mobile platforms, many of those offered are produced by a singular developer, leaving a strong opportunity to slide into this area.

											<br>
											<br>
											To start the project, 16 participants were gathered and screened, moving forward only with those who had played mobile games within the last month, and interviews were done to better understand the playing habits 
											of mobile gamers. Some additional questions were also asked in order to gauge interest in the style of game the project was aiming to create as well as to understand what features players might expect and prefer in 
											such a game.  Participants were asked the following questions, some open ended and others multiple choice where appropriate:

																As the first step of iterating on the initial wireframes a tree test was conducted in order to improve the navigation of the design and evaluate the initial site structure developed previously, seen in the initial information architecture.
																<b>One of the main findings from the Tree Test was the confusion centered around where certain content was expected to be in the application.</b> While participants were successful 
																in navigating to the sections where they would hire new zoo staff and to the game play, they were not successful in finding where they would navigate to in order to find animals 
																they do not yet possess (“Your Collection”). <b>70% of users failed to navigate to the “Your Collection” section, while the other 30% of participants were only able to arrive at the
																 correct section indirectly (Figure 1). No participants' first click led them to the correct section, the “Exploration” page under a “Your Collection” button.</b> In contrast when participants were asked <b>how they would
																 navigate to get to the puzzle game play or where to hire new zoo staff, the success rate was 90% and 100% respectively (Figures 2 & 3)</b>

															As a result of these findings, the collection section was moved into the “Animal Info” page in the reworked information architecture and the Exploration section was remade to only house the path towards the game play. 
															This decision allowed us to line up our navigation with user expectations which would prevent any confusion or incorrect actions when navigating to important, commonly used features of the game.

																	The prior tree test results which highlighted that 90%  of the participants were able to correctly navigate to the game play section accentuate this user flow (60% arrived directly), highlighting the directness and ease of navigation for users whom only require two clicks after their initial choice of the 
																	exploration section. For users who did not take the correct path, the 10% observed in the tree test, they are given amble opportunities to navigate back after every
																	choice they make allowing them to correct their mistakes easily with one simple click returning them all the way back to the home page from whatever section they're currently in. 
																	<b>Another important note, given that 30% of the tree test participants did not arrive at the goal directly (meaning they would have an opportunity to get lost in other sections) it was important to 
																	make the choices distinct and easy to understand to prevent incorrect choices. As such, the names attributed to the navigation buttons on the home page were reworded to be more specific in their meaning.</b>
																	Instead of "Animal Exploration" and "Animal Info", of which the latter was the correct choice to get to the game play, they were now named "Exploration" and "Animals". This change would still keep the 
																	main meanings of the previous options, which would prevent the tree test results from being invalidated completely, but now instead made a clear distinction between the two to prevent confusion and incorrect choices.

																This flow was much larger than the previous, mainly because this task required users to delve deeper into the application. 
																
																In ideal circumstances, users would only need two three clicks to get to the hiring screen. However, because of the need to delve deeper, the user encounters more screens with various options 
																to get lost in when compared to the previous user flow. Thus, it was important to highlight the various methods users were given to correct their mistakes, as well as how navigation pages were 
																kept to a minimum as to not require users to click the back button multiple times to return to where they need to be. <b>Unlike with the previous user flow for the game play section, participants had a much higher success rate at navigating to
																this end goal (100% of the participants correctly arrived at section to hire new staff, 10% indirectly), thus the "Management" label was kept as there was no indication that changing it would lead to any benefits or lower navigation errors.</b>
																
																<br>
																<br>
																One final important thing to note is how the “Failure” conditions end up being relatively deep into both user flows because of how many opportunities users are given to return towards the correct path.

																		accompanying features.  Some other changes to the information architecture included a Shop section, and the aforementioned “Your Collection” section into the “Animal Info” section.

															<i><h3>Text Hierarchy</h3></i>		
															<br>
															
															<span class="palt">
																Good text hierarchy practices were followed throughout the creation of the initial prototype. Headings are consistent in size and are always the largest text on a screen. Important text information is larger 
																in size than descriptor text for elements (14px). As a result, the screen and content on the screen is easily legible, content sections are easily discernible and are oftentimes separated by not only differing text sizing, 
																but also borders and backgrounds.

																<i><h3>Text Size
																</h3></i>		
																<br>
																
																<span class="palt">
																	Text sizing is consistent between similar use cases. Screen Headings are the largest with a near 60px size (Exact sizing is not available due to the custom font used), section headings on pages are then the second largest size (near 46px), 
																	the last consistent text size used was for miscellaneous text (14px). This 14px text was used for every 
																	piece of text apart from the headings, section headings, and button text. Those buttons have a variety of text sizing according to the button size, thus aren't consistent in size. They range from 14px to around 30px.

																	<i><h3>Contrast</h3></i>		
																	<br>
																	
																	<span class="palt">
																		On initial inspection, multiple elements did not pass the WCAG AA contrast guidelines. There was not enough contrast between the white text and slightly dark backgrounds it was placed on with
																		many initially having contrast ratios as low as 2.5:1.  After a quick iteration, the backgrounds for the non-adhering text were darkened slightly and a dark outline was given to smaller text to increase 
																		the contrast ratio to at least a 4.5:1 ratio making them WCAG AA contrast compliant at a minimum.

																		<i><h3>Moving Content</h3></i>		
																		<br>
																		
																		<span class="palt">
																			The prototype does include moving components such as the slight bouncing of the various animal sprites, however none of the content contains flashing or blinking lights so there are no concerns over photosensitivity and seizures at the moment or in the forseeable future.
																			 Despite the low risk of any major issues, an option is available under the settings menu to turn off all cosmetic motion such as the animal idle animations.

																			<i><h3>Color Blindness</h3></i>		
																			<br>
																			
																			<span class="palt">
																				In order to be inclusive to those with different types of color blindness the prototype was designed to not place importance on the color of various required interface interactions. 
																				For example, buttons are all labeled and their design is kept consistent throughout the application. Thus, even without any color,  buttons and interactable elements 
																				are visually distinct. Other elements (such as the bubbles in the game play screen) have unique visual elements to visually separate them without the use of color as well 
																				(each bubble uses a different animal icon).

																				<i><h3>A Short Retrospective On The Project</h3></i>		
																				<br>
																				
																				<span class="palt">
																					As with any type of work one does, there is a lot I'm unhappy about, and a lot I believe I was blinded about during the design process.
																					 For starters I will say that I'm content with the research done for this project, a lot of my gripes rest not on that, but on the design side of the work.
																					<br>
																					<br>
																					If given enough time and resources I would have used different visual elements for this project. However, given the time I had as well as not being a pixel artist, 
																					I was limited to what I could find for free from various talented artists. As a result, I believe the prototype does not have a 100% cohesive 
																					look to it precisely because it's a hodgepodge of work from various artists including myself.
																					<br>
																					<br>
																					Expanding on that previous point, I didn't like how a lot of the buttons and framings turned out. This was one aspect I believe I was blinded about during the design process. I believe I was too invested in keeping a cohesive “pixel” theme and I ended up settling for subpar work in some sections just because I thought they fit thematically at the time. If I was to work on this project further I would first attempt to collect more outside opinions then potentially rework some of the navigation UI visuals.
																					<br>
																					<br>
																					Keeping up with what I'd do if I continued working on the project, usability testing would be what I pursued next using the prototype. Tasks would ideally partially focus on aspects of the project that were part of previous research, such as the navigation, making sure the changes made using the previous data were successful. Another task would ideally ask participants to go through the zoo building process, testing the other important mechanic of the game. 
																					<br>
																					<br>
																					Finally, as to not be so somber, I was content with the information architecture and overall user experience in regards to navigation. Thankfully because of this, I believe that even if I went back and reworked some of the UI as I mentioned, as a whole it wouldn't take too much time as the underlying work is something I feel is sound.
